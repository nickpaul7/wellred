    <p>The Well "Red" Book Club is all about getting into good books and even better friendships. It's an inviting place where ladies gather, chat about the book of the month, and just enjoy each other's company. Sure, the discussions can get deep, but the laughs and camaraderie make it all worth it. It's not just a club, it's a crew of friends bonded over books.

    <p>James A. Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will, he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration, a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back.</p>
